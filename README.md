Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Transactions Data || Dealing with the imbalanced data


In this project, we use Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn to uncover the mysteries of credit card fraud detection. Our story begins with a unique datasetâ€”an assortment of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. In this dataset, spanning just two days, cases of fraud are hidden among the legitimate transactions. It's a interesting puzzle.
